As always, this cog is in beta, but available and should be working fine.\nActually, you've installed a normal version of akinator.py, but you can speed it up by using `[p]pipinstall akinator.py[fast_async]`, if you error out, you may be unable to get the speedup.\nError should be reported at my repo, at https://github.com/Predeactor/Predeactor-Cogs, but go get some support in my server, in here: https://discord.gg/zg6ydua",
